## Calibration Guide

For vehicle onboard testing make sure you have calibrated all sensors. For sensor calibration, please refer to [Apollo 2.0 Sensor Calibration Guide](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/docs/quickstart/apollo_2_0_sensor_calibration_guide.md) before you proceed.

## Hardware and Software Installation

Please refer to [Apollo 2.0 Hardware and System Installation Guide](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/docs/quickstart/apollo_2_0_hardware_system_installation_guide%20v1.md)
for the steps to install the hardware components and the system software, as well as [Apollo Software Installation Guide](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/docs/quickstart/apollo_software_installation_guide.md).

## Dreamview Usage Table

For questions regarding Dreamview icons refer to the [Dreamview Usage Table]( https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/docs/specs/dreamview_usage_table.md).

## Onboard Test

1. Plug-in an external hard-drive to any available USB port in the host machine. 

2. Turn on the vehicle, and then the host machine.

3. Launch Docker Release Container.

4. Launch DreamView.

    Note: Use your favorite browser to access HMI web service in your host machine browser with URL http://localhost:8888.

5. Select Vehicle and Map.
    
    Note: You'll be required to setup profile before doing anything else. Click the dropdown menu to select your HDMap and vehicle in use. The list are defined in [HMI config file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/master/modules/dreamview/conf/hmi.conf).

    Note: It's also possible to change the profile on the right panel of the HMI, but just remember to click "Reset All" on the top-right corner to restart the system.

6. Start Modules.

    Click the "Setup" button.
